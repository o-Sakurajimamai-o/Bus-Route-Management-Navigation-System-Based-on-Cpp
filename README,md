# Bus Route Management & Navigation System

A comprehensive C++ console application for urban bus route management and navigation. This project was developed as a Data Structures and Algorithms coursework, featuring standard graph theory algorithms built entirely from scratch.

## Key Features

The system provides an interactive CLI with 10 core capabilities:

1. **Shortest Path Routing:** Calculates the shortest distance between any two stations using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.
2. **Minimum Cost Routing:** Finds the most economical route based on edge weights (ticket prices).
3. **K-Shortest Paths:** Computes the top *K* alternative shortest paths using the **A* Search Algorithm**.
4. **Path Counting:** Determines the total number of valid shortest and lowest-cost paths between two nodes.
5. **Minimum Transfers:** Finds the route requiring the fewest bus changes using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
6. **Network Connectivity & MST:** Uses **Kruskal's Algorithm** and **Union-Find (Disjoint Set)** to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree and identify isolated subnetworks.
7. **Dynamic Graph Modification:** Supports real-time addition and deletion of bus routes (edges) on the fly.
8. **Station Lookup:** Query detailed adjacency information for all or specific bus stations.

## Data Structures

To maximize performance and demonstrate algorithmic rigor, this project relies on custom-built core data structures:

* **Graph Representation:** Array-based Adjacency List for compact memory usage, fast random access, and cache locality—ideal for dense graphs.
* **Custom Priority Queue:** Instead of relying solely on `<queue>`, a custom templated Min-Heap (`namespace priority`) was implemented from scratch. This custom heap powers both the Dijkstra and A* optimizations.
* **Disjoint Set (Union-Find):** Implemented with path compression (`find` function) for $O(1)$ amortized time complexity during MST construction.

## Compilation & Usage

This project has no external dependencies and uses standard C++ libraries. It can be compiled with any modern C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

```bash
# Compile the source code (Optimization flag -O2 is recommended)
g++ -o bus_system 公交线路管理系统.cpp -O2

# Run the executable
./bus_system

## Initialization & Sample Input
Upon starting, the system will prompt you to initialize the graph. You can input the total number of stations, total routes, followed by [Start] [End] [Cost] [Distance] for each route.

```bash
9   // Total stations
8   // Total edges
1 2 2 3
1 4 1 4
2 6 3 7
4 6 6 9
5 3 11 12
2 7 17 21
3 7 100 100
8 9 0 0
```
